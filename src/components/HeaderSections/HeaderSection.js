      <h1>YAY! ü•≥ You've made it to giomoscato.com</h1>
      <h4>Who is Giovanni Moscato? </h4>
      <p>I started programming about 4 years ago at my community college and began to grow more interest in it as I progressed through school. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Originally I was going to school for VFX or some kind of art program. 
        I have always had a love for art and music but I also wanted to work in the tech industry. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>My dream career would involve combing technology and art together to create experiences that users really love. 
        <br></br>At the moment I have a decent range of experience in programming and design aspects. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Currently I am trying to figure out what niche of programming I'd like to focus on. 
        Recently I have begun to explore Machine Learning and Web Dev!

        <p>
            Here are some of my favorite and most impressive projects I've aready completed.
            Most of the source code is publicaly available on my github. 
        </p>
        <h4> C++ Compiler for IEEE 754 float converter : </h4>

        <p>I created a IEEE 754 standard converter to convert hexadecimal ( and decimal) numbers into floating point.</p>
        <p> This is my original code and It does have a few errors here and there discussed in DOC. 
            <br></br>Just press the green RUN arrow and then click next to the orange arrow when prompted. You may enter a hexadecimal number or decimal.

        <h1>Unity / C# video game Pink Balls: </h1>
        <p>
            The game is based on velocity. 
            <br></br>You have to keep pressing the move keys to gain enough momentum to reach the end zone! Watch out for cubes they will slow you down.  
        </p>

          <a href="https://yupimaperson101.itch.io/pink-balls">Play Pink Balls on itch.io</a>
        </iframe>

        <p>I designed and developed this game completley on my own with some inspiration. I was going for a "monkey ball" type game.
           This game although simple at first glance was extremely hard to make and has many, many bugs that I had to fix.  
           The game is finished however and beatable. There is a menu, main gameplay loop, and end goal. 
           Please reach out to me if you find a bug. Also, I plan to make more levels at some point.
        </p>
