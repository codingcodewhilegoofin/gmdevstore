### The goals for this repository are:

5. Contribute to the github community

## Install
	npm install
	npm start

Special alias I wrote to speed up git and deploy cycle. Great for 1 developer but hinders git update standards.

	alias GRG='git add . ; git commit -m "updated"; git push ; npm run deploy'

	GRG



## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
